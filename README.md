# All-In-One WFH System Backend 🖨️ 

All-In-One, a printing solution company, wants to develop a web application to manage and track work-from-home (WFH) arrangements. The current Excel-based tracking system lacks governance, leading to confusion. The new system should allow staff to request regular or ad-hoc WFH days, include an approval process, and provide visibility for management to track staff availability in the office, addressing flexibility without productivity loss.

2. For development, it is recommended to use nodemon which automatically restarts the server when file changes are detected:

    `npm run dev`
